    Module represents functions that marks and kicks inactive users.
    Not crucial for session management, but helps sometimes.
    May be separated from this application in future because of the impact on performance.

    Here I reference to 2 specific roles:
    1. Bot's special role (bot uses it to mark people that are inactive for some time after joining the server,
        didn't verified their profile) [BSR].
    2. Server's special role (server uses this role to mark people that are not verified
        since they joined the server) [SSR].

    Preferable use of this module is:
    1. Mark inactive users with BSR (command `markInactive).
    2. Wait for some time (e.g. 7 days), send people message somehow that they going to be kicked
        if they will not verify their profiles within this time.
    3. Kick inactive users.
