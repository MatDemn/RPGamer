class Poll(commands.Cog):
    """
    Module that provides various functions to cope with
    polls. You can make poll, sum it up and mention those
    players that didn't vote. Pretty useful to establish
    proper date for session.

    Typical workflow for this module is:
    1.   Enter command to make session poll.
    2.   Wait for players (they must be players of at least 1 session,
    otherwise the algorithm won't count them) to vote.
    Couple of days should do the job.
    2.5. Enter command to mention lazy players who didn't vote (make them vote or
    exclude them from session poll results).
    3.   Sum up the poll to see which session is playable.

        For future releases:
    This may be a good idea to make some special role for this players
    to mark them for bot. Session polls could ping them if the poll is made
    or if the results come out of it.
